# checkout.py
# The "Place Order" feature — the complete user-facing workflow.
#
# This is the FEATURE we will test in Step 2 (Feature/Functional Testing).
# It coordinates cart, inventory, orders, and notifications to complete
# a purchase from start to finish.
#
# From the user's perspective, the feature is:
#   "I have items in my cart. I click Checkout. My order is confirmed,
#    my cart is cleared, and I receive a confirmation."
